# Bird Addition

The next feature I was told to implement was the bird. This turns out to be a big feature that will take some time. I was told to add a bird to the game that flies through the sky and the player can possess the bird. Once the player has possesed the bird we can see from the birds perspective but we can not control the bird. To start of I added a bird to the game and gave that bird a nav mesh agent and made it fly through the sky randomly between 3 points. This part was pretty straightforward because I did not have to touch any old code I was just able to create a new script. The challenge came with possesing the bird which is a mechanic thats already in the game with the wolf and the deer. This meant I would need to figure out who the player posses the deer and apply this to the bird. As mentioned earlier this porject is a bit of a mess so it took ages just finding the methods that apply and then making them apply to the bird aswell. At this point I am able to right click on the bird and start the possesing animation but the second the game tries to give me control of the bird everything breaks. I will now need to work on the game not breaking when I try to possess the bird.
