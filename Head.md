# Head Bobble Feature 

This was the first feature I worked on for this game. I was asked to implement a way where it looks and feels like the players movement affects the main camera view. This means that when the player moves or runs the camera shakes up and down a bit making it more realistic and less static. I wrote a script for this and added it to the player. Once he starts moving a bool is set true and the camera will react accordingly to make the "head bobble effect" work. Once the player stops the bool will set false and the shaking stops.
Here is a picture or link of the script.
