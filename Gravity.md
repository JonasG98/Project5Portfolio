# Gravity



The games gravity was not working correctly when I started on this project and it was my job to try and fix it. While I did not 100% fix it I did make it better and more like earths gravity compared to the moonlike gravity it had before that. Here are some pictures of the code I added to make this work. Whoever implemented the gravity before me must have screwed up somewhere because if you increased the weight of our player above 5kgs, which is ridiculously low, then he was not able to jump anymore. Also, when jumping down a hill you were able to just kinda float down the hill never touching the ground until you were completely at the bottom.
